## Inspiration 🌌
Our inspiration came from the theme itself "Astro" which is related to the galaxy, space, and the universe. 

## What it does 😯
Nebula is a site where you can see 3D models of the solar system. It also has an AI based on real life astronauts and astrophysicists that you can chat with and ask some questions.

## How we built it 🏗️
It's mainly made with vite and three.js for the 3d models, pure CSS for the other things such as our about us page, chatbox, and some other site components. The AI chat is made with python.

## Challenges we ran into 😣
First, we tried creating the whole site in react.js but we couldn't use three.js with it, so we tried vite which worked smoothly. Despite timezones, which is one of the most challenging parts of this hackathon, we still did it!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎖️
We are proud of the 3D models, and the effort of each one of us. We may have been through a lot of challenges but this made us stronger and motivated us.

## What we learned 🤔
We learned that working and adjusting while living in different timezones can be hard and that there will always be drastic adjustments upon working with each other.

## What's next for Nebula ✨
We are thinking to continue this unfinished project and hopefully, we will be able to share some information about our universe.
